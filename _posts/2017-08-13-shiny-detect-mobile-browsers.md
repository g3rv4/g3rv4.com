If you have a shiny app, you don't pay for the pro version, and you want to detect mobile browsers (to tweak your logic) then this post is for you.

# Why I wanted to do so

[My wife](https://d4tagirl.com) is working on a [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app... and she needed to show a [plotly](https://plotly.com/) graph to desktop users and a [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) graph to mobile users.

# Check the user agent, he said

My first suggestion was for her to check out the user agent... she did it by using     `session$request$HTTP_USER_AGENT` and locally, it worked just fine. The fun part was when she deployed the code to her shiny server...

She wouldn't get a user agent at all. Of course, I forgot to pass the header on nginx... but, even after I did (and verified on the shiny server traffic logs that it was being received by shiny) the value was still empty. And the reason was... [it's a Pro feature](https://docs.posit.co/shiny-server/#proxied-headers)! I understand they need to make money out of their beautiful software, but this sounds... odd to me.

# How do we do it?

Aaanyway, then thanks to [Dean Attali](https://twitter.com/daattali)'s suggestion, we started looking into how to actually do that via Javascript. After all, a shiny app is just a web app.

After a couple failed attempts with [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs) (it requested to install V8 and it was heavy heavy heavy) I discovered [input bindings](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/building-inputs.html). They're just a clean way for you to implement your own shiny elements, and trigger whatever code you want on Javascript.

They're not super complicated to set up... but just to save you a couple minutes of your life, I'll share my solution :)

## The javascript code

I created a `www/js/mobile.js` file with this content:

```
var isMobileBinding = new Shiny.InputBinding();
$.extend(isMobileBinding, {
  find: function(scope) {
    return $(scope).find(".mobile-element");
    callback();
  },
  getValue: function(el) {
    return /((iPhone)|(iPod)|(iPad)|(Android)|(BlackBerry))/.test(navigator.userAgent)
  },
  setValue: function(el, value) {
  },
  subscribe: function(el, callback) {
  },
  unsubscribe: function(el) {
  }
});

Shiny.inputBindings.register(isMobileBinding);
```

This is kind of cheating... as I know there will be no changes (if you're visiting on a mobile device, that's not going to change on this session) I'm triggering the `callback()` (what generates R to update the value) as soon as the element is initialized... and `getValue` just does a very rudimentary regex check on the user agent.

## The R code

All you need to do is:

1. Define the `mobileDetect` function
2. Add it to the `ui` element (when you're interested about it)
3. Use it on the server :) now you can tell if the user is on a mobile device or not

Before your `ui` element, define this method:

```
mobileDetect <- function(inputId, value = 0) {
  tagList(
    singleton(tags$head(tags$script(src = "js/mobile.js"))),
    tags$input(id = inputId,
                class = "mobile-element",
                type = "hidden")
  )
}
```

That just loads the javascript file and creates an html hidden input. Then, as you're defining your `ui`, you need to use it specifying what name you'll assign to it like this:

```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Are you on a mobile device?"),

  mobileDetect('isMobile'),
  textOutput('isItMobile')
))
```

And then... it's going to be magically available on the server! you can just reference the element as if it was a built-in shiny one:

```
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  output$isItMobile <- renderText({
    ifelse(input$isMobile, "You are on a mobile device", "You are not on a mobile device")
  })
})
```

I put together a tiny example project. You can [see its code here](https://github.com/g3rv4/mobileDetect) or [view it running on shinyapps.io](https://g3rv4.shinyapps.io/mobileDetect/) (if I have enough hours left :P)
