Have you ever had your local IIS run a site `local.something.com` and eventually needed to test it on your phone (to optimize it beyond the emulator) or to share it with a coworker? you may end up doing lots of releases to your development environment just to see minor layout changes.

If you have, and you'd like to expose your environment either on your network, then this article is for you. Otherwise, just go on with your life ;)

## The problem
It's fairly straightforward: You have a site (let's say `local.mse.com`) on your machine and you want to access it from another device on your network (in my case, mobile devices).

## The solution
There are several ways to solve this, but I'm convinced this is the easiest one (if you have a better option *please* comment below).

Basically it all comes down to having the client devices resolve the `local.mse.com` domain to you computer's IP. If you're dealing with computers, then you can just change their `hosts` files, but that's not so easy when you want to use mobile devices to test.

### What you need
All you need to know your network IP (I'm going to assume it's `192.168.1.144` because that's mine). You may want to have your DHCP server assign always the same IP to your machine to make the whole setup persistent, but that's not required.

If you have a router with `DNSMasq` and you have admin access to it, then that's all you need. If you don't, I'm going to show how easy it is to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run `DNSMasq` on your Windows machine.

### What to have to do
* Ensure that your Windows firewall accepts incoming connections on the 80/443 ports on the `192.168.1.144` interface.
* Ensure that the sites you want to share on IIS have a binding for the `192.168.1.144` IP.

#### If you have a router with `DNSMasq`
* On your router, add the following `DNSMasq` options so that when any device on your network asks for `local.mse.com`, your router replies with `192.168.1.144` (I'm adding a couple more, the ones I use at my cool job!)

```
address=/local.mse.com/192.168.1.144
address=/local.sstatic.net/192.168.1.144
address=/local.talent.stackoverflow.com/192.168.1.144
```

This is how it looks on mine:

What this change does is telling your router to resolve `local.mse.com` to your IP, so when a device on your network asks for `local.mse.com`, your router replies with `192.168.1.144` regardless on what's on the real `mse.com` zone.

#### If you don't have a router with `DNSMasq`
You could use any DNS server (and you could skip the docker setup) but IMO nothing beats DNSMasq's simplicity even if it's running as a docker container.

* [Install docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
* Ensure that your Windows firewall accepts incoming connections on the 53/tcp and 53/udp ports on the `192.168.1.144` interface.
* Run [my image](https://hub.docker.com/r/g3rv4/dnsmasq/) (forked from [andyshinn/dnsmasq](https://hub.docker.com/r/andyshinn/dnsmasq/)) starting `DNSMasq` on a docker container
```
run -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN g3rv4/dnsmasq --address=/local.mse.com/192.168.1.144 --address=/local.sstatic.net/192.168.1.144 --address=/local.talent.stackoverflow.com/192.168.1.144
```
* On the devices you want to use to test, set the DNS to `192.168.1.144`

### Profit!
And that's it! now every device (or the devices you set up, if you followed the docker route) on your network can access to `local.mse.com` and it will be handled by your computer.
